# Nerofea - Software Engineer, Architect, Product Conceptualizer, Mathematician

Full-stack Web3 mathematical water goddess ðŸŒŠ
I write code that flows â€” Rust streams, WASM ripples, Python tides, C++ currents.
From ZK proofs to GPU shaders, I architect systems where math meets magic.

I am open for collaborations, live webinars, live trainings, teaching opportunities, live speaking opps, job opps and contracts and potential investment opportunities. E-mail me at nerofea.official@gmail.com
