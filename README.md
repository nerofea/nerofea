### ðŸŒ± Ideas I'm Exploring

- Decentralized governance through product UX  
- Privacy-preserving shopping and social commerce  
- Twitch-native auctions powered by smart contracts  
- Visual dev tools for AI-assisted product design  
- Real-time voting flows for live entertainment  

Most of these tie into NFN (Nerofea Functionality Network) â€” a modular vision Iâ€™m prototyping one repo at a time.
